# Security-Document-Reboot games
I am apart of a small games developing company called Reboot games. We consist of around 13 developers, designers and artists and all work together creating games within our Westherts College campus. At the top we have our lectures Mike Watkins, Manish Gadhvi and Thiago Viana and they all work together to make sure our projects and games head in the right direction to maximize their success rates.

As mentioned earlier we all work from our Watford based Westherts college campus, but we all also do work from home when we are not attending the college. The systems and software we use at college need to be high end to support the developing of professional level games. This being said every system we use within our room is up to a standard that we all agree is perfect for our work and every system is the exact same to make sure we are all equal and no one is left out of something, just because their system is not at the level of the others. These are the specs of the systems we use:

These systems cost around £1500 and are provided by the college to us.

 Additionally, we use a lot of software when developing and creating games. A few examples of these softwares are Unity, which is a game developing platfrom which we used to bring our game ideas to life in. We use to it created animations, art and the base foundations of the game. A full pro license of Unity costs £125 a month which again is paid for by the college. Another group of programs  we use is a nice and simple one which everyone is familiar with: Word, Powerpoint and Word pad. We use these softwares and programs to create our documentation for our games, which will contain the scope of our game, what the game is about, how we want it to play and everything we want this game to be. Additionally, we will use ones like Powerpoint to create powerpoints that we show clients that come to us looking to do business with us these powerpoints show off our skills, our ideas we have come up with about their game such as concept art and general ideas/informationw e feel is relevant to the project they are asking us to take on.


### Types of Secuirty risks
Every business knows they need its employees to thrive and survive Eventhough businesses know the risks their employees are in terms of security some organisations dont understand the severity of the errors their employees can cause; in some cases human error can be worst than technology error, for example when hardrives crash and become corrupt, yes it is very bad for the company but more times than less they are going to have back up of that information. On the other hand when it comes to human error it is a lot easier for a hacker, or people trying to get into the organisation's building to gain access important files. When in conversation a common human error is saying things that just 'slip out'. A good 'human hacker' will have the communications skills to win over the employees trust just by talking to them, and in this conversation the hacker can instigate certain topics than can easily lead the employee to say something he/she shouldnt have; or can say things to break these employees. Breaking employees can be done by saying things the hackers know are going to trigger something within the employee, this can be done by researching the employee and finding things that are sensitive to them. Additionaly, a huge plus for hackers is when it comes to 'human hacking' unlike software hacking eveything you find out is not encrypted so they dont need to spend copious amounts of time cracking codes, and trying to get into systems. Another couple examples of human error can be seen as employees using weak password and not changing them reguarly, being careless when it comes to handling data like sending emails containing imporant data to the wrong person and finally having low security awareness for example clicking links without thinking and the same with downloading random software. These types of risks are classed as human based risks. Reboot games are no different and we are all trained and experienced in online security.

A huge risk to businesses is software or systems crashes and most businesses will have some sort of hardrives within their business premises, that contains some imporant data or valuable data. When software or systems crash, this can cause data to become corrupted and unusable, occasionally you can use other software that will try to uncorrupt this data but if used incorrectly it can cause more harm than good. Additionally, hackers being able to access organisaitons software and systems is another software error/risk. No software on earth is unbreakable/impenetrable, when it comes to hackers gaining access to software and systes it is like a game of cat and mouse. A company creates a piece of software, then somebody breaks into it, the company will then need to make it harder for the hacker, the hacker will then again gain access, and this cycle continues until the hacker gives up, gets what they want or the creater faces they cannot keep this hacker out and also gives us. Lastly, software error can be described as a system failure, software failure or when someone is able to gain access to a system or software, it is that systems/softwares fault/error. These type of risks are classified as software risks/errors. Within our organisation we all have back ups of our wokr to make sure if there is a crash minimal damage is done to our work.

Going back to my first paragraph about human errors will lead me onto my next topic which is social engineering. Essentially, social engineering is the act of exploiting, tricking or using human psychology to gain access to buildings, data and systems. Social engineering is a very difficult risk to protect yourself and company from. Your businesses software and systems can be the most secure in the world, but all this secuirty means nothing if your employees can easily be used to gain access to a door, room or system. The same goes for the firewall that you have, it means nothing when an employee clicks on a malicious facebook link thinking its a funny video from their friend. A perfect example of social engineering is when someone is tricked into letting someone into the building without any credentials. A social hacker will try to build trust with the victim and give them a false sense of friendship, to maximize the hackers chance of being let in. Within Reboot games we are all again experienced with social engineering and can identify when someone is trying to manipulate one of us, to get something out of us.

### Security procedures
We have procedures, policies and rules that ensure the safety and well-being of everyone associated with that business. A few examples are:

* Entering the building using ID- if you do not have an ID ask reception 
* Logging in using login and password - if you do not have these ask the staff at student admin
* Uploading work - if you can not upload work, as the teacher or again student support
* Entering the class using ID - if you can not enter room ask student admin

When entering the building an ID needs to be scanned before you are able to gain acess to any of the classrooms, additionally if you do not have your ID with you will need to get stamped after giving your date of birth and name to the reception to check if you do attend the college. Another procedure for the college is when logging into the computers you will be prompted to use your login and password to gain access to the computers. Entering the room is also a security procedure, you first need to right our right class, scan your college ID card then the door should give you access if your card has the rights to, then just walk into the room. Lastly, we have uploading work, this is another procedure for uploading work securely. You will need to make sure you're loggined into a computer then go onto the college's website, proceed to login to its learning, find your class, and upload your work there, but in our case we have to upload out work to github or by email. So login into Github on google and click on repositories and upload work there, or send an email containing the work to Mike or Manish which as i meantioned at the start are the 

### Third party VPN configuration
#### Firewall
When it comes to firewall configuration you need to make sure you are following the set rules and not cutting any corners, as it is a waste of resources, money and time to create a firewall that is not fully complete or has been short cut. A firewall is a network device that decides whether certain trafic is allowed to pass through, in or out. It blocks specific traffic based on a set of defined rules the user or owner will implement; which will vary depending on who it is for. Additionally, it establishes a wall between controlled and secured internet networks, these can be untrusted or trusted outside networks, the main one being the internet.

In general firewalls are set up to let traffic from any source to reach any destination, this is called an open policy. Normally, this is because IT teams dont know what needs to be at the outset, which means they add broard rules and will start to work backwards from there. Which often means they never get around to defining firewall policies. This can be because of time pressure or just brushing it off as not a high priority. Not following configuration of defining firewall policies will leave the firewall in a perpetually exposed state which means creating an open window for hackers to enter, as instead of creating a wall for a hacker you still leave it open for them to enter. Which is a huge waste of money, resources and time.

#### VPN
A VPN is a internet security method that aims to add another layer of security to both public and private networks, like internet hotspots and broadband. A virtual private network is a secure solution in the internet that allows users/individuals, businesses and organisations to recieve and send data while keeping the secrecy of a private network. Additionally, a third party VPN is a VPN that is out sourced from within the company from an outer organisation.

An example of an impact of not configuring third party VPNs correctly. The first is a VPN is meant to add another level of security to public and private networks, so if the VPN is incorrectly configured it may not work, do what it is meant to do or create more problems for you within your network. Additionally, if it does not work then it still leaves your network vulnerable without that extra level of security it may need.


### Improving Network Security

#### DMZ 
A DMZ which stands for demiilitarized zone which some people refer to as a perimeter network is a logical subnetwork  or a physical subnetwork that exposes, contains and seperartes an internal local area network (LAN) from another untrusted networks which typically is the internet.

A DMZ is an extremely useful and beneficial tool that you can use to help better secure your network. As a DMZ seperates the internet from the local network anything that is saved or that can be downloaded from the local network can not be accessed through the internet. Additionally, anything that can be accessed from someone outside of the locla network for example something such as an email will be closed off from the public into the DMZ preventing the hacker from gaining access to anything in the DMZ.

#### Static IP
An IP address is a unique number that is given to a device, such as a printer, phone or computer and it is used to as an identity for the network to connect, send and recieve data to. Any device that connects to a network will be assigned an IP address, also a static IP is an address that will be manually assigned to that device and will not change, whereas a dynamic IP address is an IP that changes and is different to the last everytime that device connects to the network. Creating this DMZ improves network security by securely locking off important data.

When logging onto your pc if on said pc you have an Dynamic IP (DHCP) configured then anyone that is connected to your network is able to create a fake DHCP server within your network and when your pc boots up it will request an IP from the fake server, the fake server will reply with its own IP which is used as a gateway and DNS server IP address. After your connected to the fake server the hacker is able to spoof and access every data package/packet that your computer sends or recieves. Additionally, they can change and delete packets, while also able to make/create phishing attacks as well as other attacks. In essence a static address is more secure as a hacker can not access your IP unless they are physically at your pc.

#### NAT
A NAT (Network Address Translation) is the process of a network device assigning a public address to a computer or a group within a private network; usually the network device is a firewall. One of its main uses are to limit the number of public IP addresses an organization, business or company use; if thats for secuirty purposes or economy purposes. NAT improves the security of your network by not allowing anyone from the outside of your network to start/initiate connections to anyone on the inside of your network, this reduces the chance of worms, and other various types of malware.

### Risk assessment procedures 
Every organisation has risks it needs to take into account when going about business; and Reboot games is not any different. Here is my risk assessment table:

| Risk | Explanation | Probability out of 10 | Severity out of 10 | Solution |
| ---- | ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| Human error | personnel errors such as clicking a malicious link | Probability: 5 | Severity: 8 | Make sure all staff are well trained in online security |
| Break in | Criminals breaking into premises | Probabilty: 3 | Severity: 9 | Make sure all doors and windows are locked and closed |
|Power cut  | The power going out and not being able to use the systems | Probabilty: 2 | Severity: 7 | Have a back up generator in place |
| Personnel injury | Someone being electricuted, falling over or any sort of injury | Probability: 4 | Severity: 6 | Make sure all staff are trained in first aid and people know of the risks within the class |
