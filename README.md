# Security-
I am apart of a small games developing company called Reboot games. We consist of around 13 developers, designers and artists and all work together creating games within our Westherts College campus. At the top we have our lectures Mike Watkins, Manish Gadhvi and Thiago Viana and they all work together to make sure our projects and games head in the right direction to maximize their success rates.

As mentioned earlier we all work from our Watford based Westherts college campus, but we all also do work from home when we are not attending the college. The systems and software we use at college need to be high end to support the developing of professional level games. This being said every system we use within our room is up to a standard that we all agree is perfect for our work and every system is the exact same to make sure we are all equal and no one is left out of something, just because their system is not at the level of the others. These are the specs of the systems we use:

These systems cost around £1500 and are provided by the college to us.

 Additionally, we use a lot of software when developing and creating games. A few examples of these softwares are Unity, which is a game developing platfrom which we used to bring our game ideas to life in. We use to it created animations, art and the base foundations of the game. A full pro license of Unity costs £125 a month which again is paid for by the college. Another group of programs  we use is a nice and simple one which everyone is familiar with: Word, Powerpoint and Word pad. We use these softwares and programs to create our documentation for our games, which will contain the scope of our game, what the game is about, how we want it to play and everything we want this game to be. Additionally, we will use ones like Powerpoint to create powerpoints that we show clients that come to us looking to do business with us these powerpoints show off our skills, our ideas we have come up with about their game such as concept art and general ideas/informationw e feel is relevant to the project they are asking us to take on.


### Types of Secuirty risks
Every business knows they need its employees to thrive and survive Eventhough businesses know the risks their employees are in terms of security some organisations dont understand the severity of the errors their employees can cause; in some cases human error can be worst than technology error, for example when hardrives crash and become corrupt, yes it is very bad for the company but more times than less they are going to have back up of that information. On the other hand when it comes to human error it is a lot easier for a hacker, or people trying to get into the organisation's building to gain access important files. When in conversation a common human error is saying things that just 'slip out'. A good 'human hacker' will have the communications skills to win over the employees trust just by talking to them, and in this conversation the hacker can instigate certain topics than can easily lead the employee to say something he/she shouldnt have; or can say things to break these employees. Breaking employees can be done by saying things the hackers know are going to trigger something within the employee, this can be done by researching the employee and finding things that are sensitive to them. Additionaly, a huge plus for hackers is when it comes to 'human hacking' unlike software hacking eveything you find out is not encrypted so they dont need to spend copious amounts of time cracking codes, and trying to get into systems. Another couple examples of human error can be seen as employees using weak password and not changing them reguarly, being careless when it comes to handling data like sending emails containing imporant data to the wrong person and finally having low security awareness for example clicking links without thinking and the same with downloading random software. These types of risks are classed as human based risks.

A huge risk to businesses is software or systems crashes and most businesses will have some sort of hardrives within their business premises, that contains some imporant data or valuable data. When software or systems crash, this can cause data to become corrupted and unusable, occasionally you can use other software that will try to uncorrupt this data but if used incorrectly it can cause more harm than good. Additionally, hackers being able to access organisaitons software and systems is another software error/risk. No software on earth is unbreakable/impenetrable, when it comes to hackers gaining access to software and systes it is like a game of cat and mouse. A company creates a piece of software, then somebody breaks into it, the company will then need to make it harder for the hacker, the hacker will then again gain access, and this cycle continues until the hacker gives up, gets what they want or the creater faces they cannot keep this hacker out and also gives us. Lastly, software error can be described as a system failure, software failure or when someone is able to gain access to a system or software, it is that systems/softwares fault/error. These type of risks are classified as software risks/errors.

Going back to my first paragraph about human errors will lead me onto my next topic which is social engineering. Essentially, social engineering is the act of exploiting, tricking or using human psychology to gain access to buildings, data and systems. Social engineering is a very difficult risk to protect yourself and company from. Your businesses software and systems can be the most secure in the world, but all this secuirty means nothing if your employees can easily be used to gain access to a door, room or system. The same goes for the firewall that you have, it means nothing when an employee clicks on a malicious facebook link thinking its a funny video from their friend. A perfect example of social engineering is when someone is tricked into letting someone into the building without any credentials. A social hacker will try to build trust with the victim and give them a false sense of friendship, to maximize the hackers chance of being let in.

### Security procedures
Every business will have its own procedures to protect the business, staff and customers; these procedures and policy work together to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone associated with that business. A few examples are:

* Entering the building
* Logging in 
* Uploading work
* Entering the class

When entering the building an ID needs to be scanned before you are able to gain acess to any of the classrooms, additionally if you do not have your ID with you will need to get stamped after giving your date of birth and name to the reception to check if you do attend the college. Another procedure for the college is when logging into the computers you will be prompted to use your login and password to gain access to the computers. Entering the room is also a security procedure, you first need to right our right class, scan your college ID card then the door should give you access if your card has the rights to, then just walk into the room. Lastly, we have uploading work, this is another procedure for uploading work securely. You will need to make sure you're loggined into a computer then go onto the college's website, proceed to login to its learning, find your class, and upload your work there, but in our case we have to upload out work to github or by email. So login into Github on google and click on repositories and upload work there, or send an email containing the work.
