### Keeping data safe
1. Only trust websites that contain HTTP

HTTP stand for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure is a method of making sure the communication between your browser and the web server is secure. One way to identify that you are secure is a green padlock in the top left of your screen (while in a browser). To reduce the chances of your data being leaked, or your PC being breached make sure you only use websites that have the pad lock in the top left and https infront of the URL.
